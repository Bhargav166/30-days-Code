Day 7:- In the GitHub repository, Infinity-AI(Infinite Learn and Grow)/30-days-code inside the Day-7 folder create your_name.py file as defined in the readme.md file.

- Sets:- 
    it_companies = {'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'},
    A = {19, 22, 24, 20, 25, 26},
    B = {19, 22, 20, 25, 26, 24, 28, 27},
    age = [22, 19, 24, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24].

- Find the length of the set it_companies
- Join A and B
- Find A intersection B
- Convert the ages to a set and compare the length of the list and the set, which one is bigger?
